# Sample GIFs for Testing

To test the ChibiViewer application, you'll need some GIF files with proper transparency. Here are some options for getting suitable GIF files:

## Option 1: Use Existing Sprite Sheets

There are many free sprite sheets available online that can be converted to GIFs:

1. Visit websites like [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-sprites) or [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/)
2. Look for sprite sheets with transparent backgrounds
3. Use a tool like [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or [EzGif](https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter) to convert sprite sheets to animated GIFs
4. Name your GIFs appropriately (e.g., "character_move.gif", "character_wait.gif", "character_sit.gif", "character_pick.gif")

## Option 2: Create Your Own

If you have artistic skills, you can create your own animated GIFs:

1. Use a digital art tool like [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) (paid) or [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) (free)
2. Create frame-by-frame animations with transparent backgrounds
3. Export as GIFs with transparency enabled
4. Name them according to the required format

## Option 3: Download Example Pack

For quick testing, you can download a sample pack of GIFs that works with ChibiViewer:

1. Visit: [Example GIF Pack](https://example.com/chibi-viewer-sample-gifs) (Note: This is a placeholder link. Replace with an actual URL if you create a sample pack)
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Use the Import button in ChibiViewer to select the extracted folder

## Required GIF Specifications

For best results, your GIFs should meet these specifications:

- **Format**: GIF with transparency
- **Size**: All GIFs should be roughly the same dimensions (e.g., 128x128 pixels)
- **Naming**: Include the state name in the filename (move, wait, sit, pick)
- **Animation**: Smooth, looping animations work best
- **Direction**: "Move" animations should face right by default

## Naming Convention Examples

- move_character.gif or character_move.gif
- wait_idle.gif or idle_wait.gif
- sitting_sit.gif or character_sit.gif
- pick_up.gif or character_pick.gif
- misc_animation.gif (will be categorized as miscellaneous)
